# TreeSketch
An AI-shell / CLI that can create and modify an entire codebase from one sentence.

<h3>to run the project:</h3>

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/JoshuaWhitfield/TreeSketch.git treesketch
  $ cd /treesketch/core
  $ python3 main.py
```

write a cli that can handle data collection with web crawlers it should search google for keywords and recursively iterate through links found on the pages and collect their data using google custom search api. it should create files with the link names and put them in dirs with keyword names, then put those in the output dir.  if no output dir exists then the code will create it on startup. the code produces the output dir, not you. produce the code for the cli that creates the output dir.



the syntax should be:



data -collect[“keyword”] -parse[]
